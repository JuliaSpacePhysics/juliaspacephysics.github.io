This tutorial demonstrates interactive visualization of space physics data using WebGL-powered plots. Unlike static plots, these visualizations allow you to pan, zoom, and explore your data directly.

::: {.callout-note}
We use BonitoBook in Colab, which is a Julia native notebook with many additional features compared to Colab (we mainly use Colab as a computation platform). Using WGLMakie directly in Colab is currently not possible due to [this limitation](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/5369).
:::

```{julia}
#| code-summary: "Setup: install the required packages"
#| output: false
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["CDAWeb", "WGLMakie", "SpacePhysicsMakie"])
```

## Interactive Time Series Plot

This example loads OMNI solar wind data:

```{julia}
using CDAWeb
using WGLMakie, SpacePhysicsMakie

t0 = "2008-09-05T10:00:00"
t1 = "2008-09-05T22:00:00"
# The `cda` string macro provides a convenient way to fetch multiple variables from CDAWeb in a single line.
tvars = cda"OMNI_HRO_1MIN/flow_speed, Pressure"
f, axs = tplot(tvars, t0, t1)
f
```

Try interacting with the plot:

- **Scroll** to zoom in/out
- **Click and drag** to pan
- **ctrl+click** to reset the view
